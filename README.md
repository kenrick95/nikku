Web-based BRSTM player

Just open [the demo](https://kenrick95.github.io/nikku/) in modern browser, select .brstm file, and enjoy!

## What Is BRSTM?

BRSTM is a file format that contains [lossless](https://sound.stackexchange.com/a/40879) audio data that's being used for some Nintendo consoles. One of the differences with the usual audio format (MP3, etc) is that this format can contain a loop point, making it suitable for usage in games.

`.brstm` file is not included in the repository.

Some places to look for BRSTM files:

- ~~[Smash Custom Music](http://smashcustommusic.com/)~~<sup>[_dead link_]</sup>
- [Smash Custom Music Archive](https://smashcustommusic.net/) (the audio player in this site is using the ["brstm" package](https://github.com/kenrick95/nikku/tree/master/src/brstm) from this repo!)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BRSTM/)
